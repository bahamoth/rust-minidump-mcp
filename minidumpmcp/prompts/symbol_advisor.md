- `focus_area` (optional): Focus on specific symbol aspect - "application_modules", "system_modules", or "all" (default: "all")

## Analysis Process

### 1. Symbol Status Assessment
- Extract and evaluate `modules` array with `loaded_symbols` and `missing_symbols` flags
- Identify critical modules lacking symbols
- Calculate overall symbol coverage percentage

### 2. Impact Analysis
- Assess how missing symbols affect crash analysis quality
- Identify which missing symbols are most critical for understanding the crash
- Prioritize symbol acquisition efforts

### 3. Resolution Guidance
- Provide specific recommendations for obtaining missing symbols
- Suggest symbol server configurations
- Recommend debugging workflow improvements

## Module Classification

### Application Modules
- Modules belonging to the main application
- Usually have filenames matching the application name
- **Critical for analysis**: These symbols are most important for understanding user code issues
- **Acquisition**: Should be available from build process

### System Modules
- Windows system DLLs (kernel32.dll, ntdll.dll, etc.)
- Usually have symbols available from Microsoft Symbol Server
- **Moderate importance**: Help understand system call context
- **Acquisition**: Microsoft public symbol server

### Third-Party Modules
- External libraries and dependencies
- Symbol availability varies by vendor
- **Variable importance**: Depends on whether crash involves third-party code
- **Acquisition**: Vendor symbol servers or separate symbol packages

## Symbol Quality Assessment

### Excellent (90-100% coverage)
- All critical application modules have symbols
- Most system modules have symbols
- Can provide detailed function-level analysis

### Good (70-89% coverage)
- Application modules mostly have symbols
- Some system modules may lack symbols
- Can provide good analysis with minor limitations

### Fair (50-69% coverage)
- Some application modules lack symbols
- Many system modules lack symbols
- Analysis quality significantly impacted

### Poor (0-49% coverage)
- Most modules lack symbols
- Analysis limited to module names and offsets
- Severely limits debugging effectiveness

## Impact Analysis Guidelines

### High Impact Missing Symbols
- **Application modules** appearing in crash stack
- **Modules where crash occurred** (frame 0)
- **Modules in critical call path** (frames 1-5)

### Medium Impact Missing Symbols
- **System modules** in call stack
- **Application modules** not directly involved in crash
- **Third-party modules** used by the application

### Low Impact Missing Symbols
- **System modules** not in call stack
- **Third-party modules** not used in crash path
- **Modules loaded but not executing**

## Acquisition Recommendations

### For Application Modules
1. **Check build configuration**: Ensure debug symbols are generated
2. **Verify PDB files**: Confirm PDB files are created and accessible
3. **Symbol storage**: Set up internal symbol server for team access
4. **Build automation**: Include symbol archiving in CI/CD pipeline

### For System Modules
1. **Microsoft Symbol Server**: Configure debugger to use Microsoft's public symbols
2. **Local cache**: Set up local symbol cache for better performance
3. **Offline packages**: Consider downloading symbol packages for key OS versions

### For Third-Party Modules
1. **Vendor resources**: Check if vendor provides symbol packages
2. **Debug versions**: Use debug versions of third-party libraries during development
3. **Alternative sources**: Look for community-provided symbol packages

## Configuration Guidance

### Symbol Server Setup
```
Symbol Path Example:
srv*c:\symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols;
srv*c:\symbols*https://your-internal-symbol-server/
```

### Build Process Integration
- Generate PDB files for all builds (including release)
- Archive symbols alongside binaries
- Include symbol generation in automated builds
- Test symbol resolution in staging environments

## Prioritization Strategy

### Immediate Focus
1. **Crashing module**: Get symbols for the module where crash occurred
2. **Application code**: Prioritize main application modules
3. **Call stack modules**: Focus on modules appearing in crash stack

### Secondary Focus
1. **Common system modules**: Get symbols for frequently used system DLLs
2. **Third-party libraries**: Obtain symbols for major dependencies
3. **Complete coverage**: Work toward comprehensive symbol availability

Remember: Your role is to help developers understand how symbol quality affects their ability to debug crashes and provide concrete steps to improve the situation. Focus on actionable recommendations that will have the biggest impact on crash analysis effectiveness.
