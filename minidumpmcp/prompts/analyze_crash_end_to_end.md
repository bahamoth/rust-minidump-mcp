- `analysis_options` (optional): Configuration for analysis depth and focus areas

## Workflow Overview

This prompt orchestrates a complete crash analysis by:
1. Preparing symbols from various sources
2. Executing minidump analysis with proper symbols

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Validate Input
- Check minidump file integrity
- Inventory available symbols
- Identify required tools

### Step 2: Prepare Symbols
- Convert native symbols to Breakpad format
- Download from symbol servers if needed
- Organize in proper directory structure

### Step 3: Execute Analysis
- Run stackwalk_minidump with prepared symbols
- Capture detailed output
- Handle any errors gracefully

### Step 4: Interpret Results
- Apply specialized analysis prompts
- Correlate findings
- Generate comprehensive report

### Step 5: Provide Recommendations
- Identify immediate action items
- Suggest code fixes
- Recommend process improvements

## Symbol Handling Strategies

### Mixed Symbol Sources
When symbols come from multiple sources:
1. Local PDB/DWARF files → Convert with extract_symbols
2. Symbol server URLs → Download and convert
3. Existing Breakpad symbols → Use directly
4. Executable with debug info → Extract symbols

### Symbol Priority
1. **Application symbols**: Most critical for root cause
2. **Direct dependencies**: Important for call stack
3. **System symbols**: Helpful for context
4. **Third-party symbols**: Nice to have

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Fresh Crash with PDBs
1. Convert PDBs to Breakpad format
2. Run stackwalk_minidump
3. Analyze with all prompts
4. Deliver comprehensive report

### Scenario: Crash with Partial Symbols
1. Use available symbols
2. Run analysis noting gaps
3. Prioritize missing symbols
4. Provide best-effort analysis

### Scenario: Production Crash
1. Download symbols from server
2. Include executable if available
3. Deep analysis with all context
4. Focus on actionable fixes

## Automation Example

```python
# Complete workflow automation
async def analyze_crash_completely(dump_path, symbol_sources):
    # Step 1: Prepare symbols
    for source in symbol_sources:
        if source.endswith('.pdb'):
            await extract_symbols(source, "./symbols")
    
    # Step 2: Run stackwalk
    result = await stackwalk_minidump(
        dump_path, 
        symbols_path="./symbols"
    )
    
    # Step 3: Analyze results
    analysis = await analyze_stackwalk_result(result)
    quality = await evaluate_symbol_quality(result)
    
    return combine_insights(analysis, quality)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always prepare symbols first**: Don't skip conversion
2. **Use verbose mode**: More data is better for analysis
3. **Check symbol quality**: Know your analysis limitations
4. **Automate workflows**: Consistency improves results
5. **Archive everything**: Keep dumps, symbols, and reports

Remember: Your role is to provide a complete, actionable workflow that takes users from "I have a crash dump" to "I know exactly what to fix." Make the complex process manageable and the results actionable.
